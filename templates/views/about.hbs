    <div class="p-5 w-50">This site was created by <b>Aman Verma</b>. It is a dynamic web application that provides
      users with up-to-date weather information for any location around the world. Developed using Node.js and
      Express.js, this project integrates data from the Weatherstack API to display current weather conditions,
      temperature, humidity, and other weather-related metrics in a visually appealing and user-friendly format.<br>
      To ensure accurate and reliable weather data, this website also utilizes geocoding through the Mapbox API
      to convert location input into geographic coordinates. This allows the application to provide weather information
      for any location entered by the user, regardless of whether it is a city, state, or specific address.<br>
      To create the user interface, this website uses Bootstrap, a popular front-end development framework that
      allows for the creation of responsive and visually appealing web pages. The hbs library, a popular templating
      engine that allows for dynamic rendering of HTML pages. The request library is also utilized to make HTTP requests
      to the Weatherstack and Mapbox APIs, enabling seamless communication between the application and external data
      sources.</div>
