    <div class="p-5 w-50">My name is <b>Aman Verma</b>. I am a <b>Backend Developer</b> with BCA and MBA Degrees and Banking experience.<br>As a highly
      motivated and detail-oriented backend developer, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and business knowledge
      to the table. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications and an MBA, I have a solid foundation in both
      technical and strategic aspects of technology.<br>
      My banking experience has given me a deep understanding of leadership, financial systems and processes, as well as
      experience in project management and stakeholder communication. As a developer, I have experience in building
      scalable and secure backend systems using Node.js, JavaScript, NoSQL, GIT, JSON, and REST APIs.<br>
      In addition, I am constantly seeking to expand my skills and knowledge through coursework, self-study, and
      personal projects. I am eager to apply my technical skills and business knowledge to a role in backend development
      in the IT industry.</div>
